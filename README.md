**[shrimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp)** is a crustacean (a form of shellfish) with an elongated body and a primarily swimming mode of locomotion â€“ typically belonging to the Caridea or Dendrobranchiata of the decapod order, although some crustaceans outside of this order are also referred to as "shrimp".
